Project: London Underground
Authors: Mehmet Kutay Bozkurt, Michael KÃ¶lling, and David J. Barnes

This application is a game concerning the London Underground. This is a very simple text-based game. Stations that are in Central London are connected by lines, and the player's task is to exit the underground. Player should find items, talk with people, and navigate the underground. The game is written in Java.

Note: This project was created under a coursework for my degree, for the Programming Practice and Applications module. We hadn't learned main ideas of "object-oriented programming," which is the reason that you wouldn't find inheritance in the codebase. Nonetheless, it was quite fun to code and create, and I created something relating to the London Underground, which is always great.
