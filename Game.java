/**
 * This class is the main class of the "London Underground" application. 
 * "World of Zuul" is a very simple, text based adventure game. Users
 * can walk around some of the underground stations in central London,
 * pick up and drop items, and try to find a way out of the stations.
 * 
 * This main class creates and initialises the parser and the processor,
 * which are used to read and process the user commands. It also creates
 * the game loop.
