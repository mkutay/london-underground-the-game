/**
 * This class is the main class of the "The London Underground" application. 
 * "The London Underground" is a simple, text based adventure game that was
 * inspired by the stations found in Central London. Players can walk
 * around some of the underground stations in the city, pick up
 * and drop items, and try to find a way out of the stations by
 * talking with characters and using items.
 * 
 * This main class creates and initialises the parser and the processor,
 * which are used to read and process the user commands, respectively.
 * It also initiates the game loop.
